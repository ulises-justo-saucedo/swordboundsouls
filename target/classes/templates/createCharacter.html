						Berserk´s inflict immense amounts of damage
						with their physical attacks; berserk's stats lack on Reiatsu,
						but they compensate it with huge amounts of attack and defense.
						Ideal for close range combats.

					<p>
						Balanced characters are well known for their
						versatility in combat. Balanced characters last a good
						amount of time in close range combat, but are also
						able to keep distance between them and their opponents
						to make use of Reiatsu.

						Spiritual characters have a large amount of Reiatsu.
						Spiritual characters engage in combat keeping the distance
						between them and their opponents in order
						to anihilate them with their powerful Reiatsu.
